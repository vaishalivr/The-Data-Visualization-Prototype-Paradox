          one we are currently using) have put guardrails to the true design

        As an architect turned designer turned developer, I am often struck by
        the resonances between the work of a designer and of a developer. Design
        is all mess and being loose at start. It takes a few iterations to get
        to understand the problem space and know which affordances to break to
        bring out something new. The work of a developer around these prototypes
        is also all mess and being loose at start. But it takes a structured set
        of logic and rules to make a design team’s prototypes work.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem">
        However, in my opinion, over the course of years the trend to make
        designers think about a problem space is taking a turn towards
        engineering-centric-way more than being creativity-centered. I say so
        because when I see these modern design tools are introducing a DOM like
        layout mechanism - components, variables, auto layouts and more - and
        while it certainly has its advantages (as seen in Figma Config 2025), it
        starts to sets limits to all possible design expressions. It is not easy
        to try odd combinations or paste something into a frame without snapping
        somewhere to its area. There is an over reliance on the inbuilt grids
        and auto layout features that tends to reduce the experimental features
        of design. Creativity also takes a back seat while trying to break
        symmetry or going off-the-grid on purpose.

      <div style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem">
        Another push to designer-turned-engineering-thinker is the recent Dev
        Mode which is - in theory - the missing bridge between design
        specifications and technical implementation. But the mindset of a
        designer is far far away from the technology that they are designing
        for.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem">
        In order to verify these design ideas - keeping in mind the key aspect
        that you cannot build a huge product all at once from prototypes - you
        have to force yourself to view them through the lens of logic and code.
        And it is during this process, we truly understand the tradeoffs while
        writing code for interactivity, data loading and test cases.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem">
        This often happens when working with data - the missing values, the
        outliers, the acceptable types and range of values. The easiest work
        around is to remove them, but then what is left in hand is not the true
        representation of the original dataset.

        <hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 20px 0" />
        <em
          >Okay, if you cannot get this and that at the same time — what is more
          important??</em

        Lately, I find myself drifting towards the ides of making a simple
        prototype using pen, paper or a design tool without a lot of pixel
        pushing, to be able to get ideas out of my head and then swiftly moving
        towards executing it in code.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem">
        I use these prototypes as a proxy for my ideas and questions that come
        up during the design phase but testing with code ensures that all
        critical mistakes are made early on and the bridge between design and
        development is aligned.
